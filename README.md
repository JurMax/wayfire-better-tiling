# Wayfire-better-tiling

This is a plugin for [Wayfire](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire) based on the simple tile plugin that makes the tiling work more like i3, so providing full keyboard control.

To install on Arch just run `makepkg --install` and otherwise you can use the build script/install using meson+ninja.
